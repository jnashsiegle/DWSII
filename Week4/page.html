							<p>Much like exploring space, or the ocean, or even our own neighborhood, humanity seems to have an inate attraction for exploring the unknown.</p>
							<p> Have you ever wondered why we have such an attraction to travel or exploring interesting locations?  Perhaps it is just the curiousity of it all.  Perhaps for some it is the "grass is greener on the other side" syndrome.  Perhaps for others it is just an appreciation for things of beauty within nature.  Whatever it is, here are a few examples of some natural interesting locations that you may enjoy.</p>
							<p>From the <a href = "http://www.boredpanda.com/amazing-places/"> &nbsp;Bored Panda:</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;  &quot;Our world is so full of wonders that new and amazing places are discovered every day, be that by professional photographers or amateurs. Different geographical locations, climatic conditions and even seasons offer the widest variety of natural wonders: pink lakes, stunning lavender or tulip fields, breath-taking canyons and mountains, and other places you can hardly believe actually exist!&quot;</p>
							<p>Some of the pictures in this collection will be of all natural sights you can find while traveling around the world, while the others have experienced human interference &mdash; but even in these cases, the result of such collaboration is spectacular.</p><p> The Japanese learned how to tame thousands of orchids and form a romantic tunnel out of them; another one was formed all the way in Ukraine by a passing train; and what eventually ends up as hot tea in our mugs, first grows in stunning tree fields in Asia.</p>
							<p>No wonder that traveling in one of the best forms of recreation &mdash; even looking at these pictures takes your mind to far away place&hellip; And yes, all those of those places are real!</p>

					<p>For those of us who are head over heals in love, here&#39;s a new destination to consider. The Tunnel of Love, located in Ukraine, used to be just another train rail section, but eventually turned into one of the most romantic spots on Earth.</p>
					<p>As trees were left to grow freely around the rails, the passing train was the only thing shaping its way through. Eventually, by crossing the Kleven village forest back and forth three times a day, the train shaped a closed tunnel according to itâ€™s size.</p>
					<p class = "last">Today the Tunnel of Love is highly popular among lovers: it is believed that if two people are sincere in their love and cross the tunnel while holding each other&#39;s hands, their wishes will come true.</p>

					<p>While not technically a tunnel, the enormous height of this remarkable place, reminds me of such.</p>
					<p>The walking paths that cut through the bamboo groves make for a nice walk or bicycle ride. The groves are particularly attractive when there is a light wind and the tall bamboo stalks sway gently back and forth. The bamboo has been used to manufacture various products, such as baskets, cups, boxes and mats at local workshops for centuries.</p>
					<p>Located in Arashiyama, Japan</p>

					<p>Kawachi Fuji Gardens in Kitakyushu, Japan ( 5 hours from Tokyo, if you take the Nozomi high speed train) is where you will find this pastel-colored fairytale tunnel. The gardens are home to about 150 Wisteria flowering plants spanning 20 different species (white, blue, purple, violet-blue and pink). This is the reason why the Wisteria tunnel is so colorful and graceful.</p>
					<p>Best time to visit is from late April to mid May (depends on the weather each year). The peak is normally at end of April to the Golden Week</p>

					<p>In few places can you experience every stage of the water cycle at once. But there's magic in the Mendenhall Ice Caves, where water runs over rocks under blue ceilings inside a partially hollow glacier.</p> 
					<p>The Mendenhall Glacier is a 12&ndash;mile&ndash;long glacier in the Mendenhall Valley, located only 12 miles from downtown Juneau in Southeast Alaska. Federally protected as part of the Mendenhall Galcier Recreation Area, a unit of the Tongass National Forest, the glacier originally had two names, Sitaantaagu (&quot;Glacier Behind the Town&quot;) and Aak'wtaaksit (&quot;Glacier Behind the Little Lake&quot;). </p>
					<p>The Ice Caves are inside the glacier, accessible only to those willing to kayak to, and then ice climb over the glacier. However, the glacier is retreating increasingly fast as global warming heats the oceans and temperatures rise.</p>

					<div class="img polaroid" style="background-image:url('images/antelope.jpg');"></div><h2>Antelope Canyon, USA</h2>
					<p> long time ago, herds of pronghorn antelope roamed freely in Antelope Canyon, which explains the canyon's English name. It is not known exactly when people first discovered Antelope Canyon. According to local Navajos, who have lived here for some time, the canyon and the LeChee area were places where cattle grazed in winter. </p>
					<p>To older Navajos, entering a place like Antelope Canyon was like entering a cathedral. They would probably pause before going in, to be in the right frame of mind and prepare for protection and respect. This would also allow them to leave with an uplifted feeling of what Mother Nature has to offer, and to be in harmony with something greater than themselves. It was, and is, a spiritual experience.</p>
					<p>The Navajo name for Upper Antelope Canyon is Tse' bighanilini, which means "the place where water runs through rocks." Upper Antelope is at about 4,000 feet elevation and the canyon walls rise 120 feet above the streambed. Located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation.</p>
					<p>Lower Antelope Canyon is Hasdestwazi, or "spiral rock arches." Located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation. </p>
