	<p><span>Groundhog Day</span> (Canadian French: Jour de la Marmotte; Pennsylvania German: Grundsaudaag, Murmeltiertag) is a day celebrated on February 2. According to folklore, if it is cloudy when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day, then spring will come early; if it is sunny, the groundhog will supposedly see its shadow and retreat back into its burrow, and the winter weather will persist for six more weeks.</p>
	
	<p>Modern customs of the holiday involve celebrations where early morning festivals are held to watch the groundhog emerging from its burrow.</p>

	<p>In southeastern Pennsylvania, Groundhog Lodges (Grundsow Lodges) celebrate the holiday with fersommlinge,[2] social events in which food is served, speeches are made, and one or more g'spiel (plays or skits) are performed for entertainment. The Pennsylvania German dialect is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak English pay a penalty, usually in the form of a nickel, dime, or quarter per word spoken, with the money put into a bowl in the center of the table.[3]</p>

	<p>The largest Groundhog Day celebration is held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with Punxsutawney Phil. Groundhog Day, already a widely recognized and popular tradition,[4] received widespread attention as a result of the <time datetime = 1993>1993</time> film Groundhog Day.[5]</p>

	<p>The celebration began as a Pennsylvania German custom in southeastern and central Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has its origins in ancient European weather lore, wherein a badger or sacred bear is the prognosticator, as opposed to a groundhog.[6] It also bears similarities to the Pagan festival of Imbolc (the seasonal turning point of the Celtic calendar, which is celebrated on February 2 and also involves weather prognostication[7]), and to St. Swithun's Day on July 15.<p>

		<h2>Early Documentation </h2>
	<p>The first documented American reference to Groundhog Day can be found in a diary entry, dated <time datetime = "1841-02-04">February 4, 1841</time>, of Morgantown, Pennsylvania, storekeeper James Morris&#58;</p>

	<p>Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks nap, but if the day be cloudy he remains out, as the weather is to be moderate.</p>

	<h2>From England, the poem:</h2>

<blockquote>If Candlemas be fair and bright,
Winter has another flight.
If Candlemas brings clouds and rain,
Winter will not come again.</blockquote>

<h2>From Scotland, the poem:</h2>

<blockquote>If Candlemas Day is bright and clear,
There'll be two winters in the year.</blockquote>

<h2>From Germany, the poem:</h2>

<blockquote>For as the sun shines on Candlemas Day,
So far will the snow swirl until May.
For as the snow blows on Candlemas Day,
So far will the sun shine before May.</blockquote>
